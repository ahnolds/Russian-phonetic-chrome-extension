# Chrome extension for Russian (phonetic Mac) keyboard
This supports adding a Chrome extension for Russian keyboard support using the
Mac phonetic keyboard layout. In particular, this is intended to aid
compatibility between OS X and Chrome OS.

The Russian (phonetic Mac) keyboard implementation is available seperately
[here](https://github.com/ahnolds/Russian-phonetic-Mac).

Chrome extension design is based on [extra-keyboards-for-chrome-os](https://github.com/google/extra-keyboards-for-chrome-os).

### Caution
According to [the Chromium Projects](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/poking-around-your-chrome-os-device):
__Modifications you make to the system are not supported by Google, may cause
hardware, software or security issues and may void warranty.__ It appears that
the only way to install the keyboard itself is to put the Chrome OS computer
into Developer mode, which is not something that the majority of users
would/should do.
