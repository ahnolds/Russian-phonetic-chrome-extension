# Chrome extension for Russian (phonetic Mac) keyboard
This supports adding a Chrome extension for Russian keyboard support using the
Mac phonetic keyboard layout. In particular, this is intended to aid
compatibility between OS X and Chrome OS.

The Russian (phonetic Mac) keyboard implementation is available seperately
[here](https://github.com/ahnolds/Russian-phonetic-Mac).

Chrome extension design is based on [extra-keyboards-for-chrome-os](https://github.com/google/extra-keyboards-for-chrome-os).
